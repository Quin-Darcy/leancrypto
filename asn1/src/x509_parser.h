 * Decode an ASN.1 universal time or generalised time field into a struct the
 * kernel can handle and check it for validity.  The time is decoded thus:
 *
 *	[RFC5280 ยง4.1.2.5]
 *	CAs conforming to this profile MUST always encode certificate validity
 *	dates through the year 2049 as UTCTime; certificate validity dates in
 *	2050 or later MUST be encoded as GeneralizedTime.  Conforming
 *	applications MUST be able to process validity dates that are encoded in
 *	either UTCTime or GeneralizedTime.
