The x86intrin code in internal/api/ext_x86_*.h are derived from GCC and Clang.
The only reason why this code is duplicated is the fact that the compiler code
cannot be included into kernel code code as is. Thus, the functions used by
leancrypto are extracted - I wished this would not have been necessary.

Anyhow, the GCC code is: GPL 3. The LLVM code is: Apache License v2.0.
