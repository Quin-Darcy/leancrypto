Changes 0.5.0-prerelease:
* enhancement: add ability to compile leancrypto for the Linux kernel

* enhancement: add Linux kenrel test code

* enhancement: make leancrypto generic such that it can be used in environments
  other than user space

* enhancement: add compile time option small_stack which ensures that
  leancrypto's stack usage is always less than 2048 (also verified by the
  compiler waring if it is bigger)

* enhancement: Add assembler accelerations for SHA3 (AVX2 and AVX512 are
  verified with NIST's ACVP service, ARMv8 Neon is yet pending)

* bug fix: Fix the SHA-3 C implementation on big-endian system (one byte-swap
  missing)

* bug fix: SHAKE128 state had wrong size causing an overflow with the
  memset_secure in lc_hash_zero

* fix: remove compile-time warnings on 32 bit systems

Changes 0.4.0:
* simplify Kyber code

* add RNG context to HKDF

* add RNG context to KMAC

* add AES 128/192/256, ECB, CBC, CTR, KW

* add lc_seeded_rng

* add lc_aead API to provide common interface to AEAD algorithms

* add KyberIES

* change API to Kyber KEM: allow caller to specify size of generated key

* add leancrypto.h for ease of use

* add SymHMAC AEAD algorithm

* add cSHAKE 128

* add KMAC 128

Changes 0.3.0:
* Introduce lc_rng.h as a common interface to the random number generators

* add KMAC DRNG

* add cSHAKE DRNG

* add SHAKE-128

* add dilithium signature PQC schema - test vectors were generated by leancrypto, but compared with the reference implementation which calculate the same results

* add kyber KEM PQC schema - test vectors were generated by leancrypto, but compared with the reference implementation which calculate the same results

* add cSHAKE AEAD cipher

* KMAC-AEAD cipher: auth key is now set to 256 bits
