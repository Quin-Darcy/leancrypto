Changes 0.4.0-prerelease:
* simplify Kyber code

* add RNG context to HKDF

* add RNG context to KMAC

* add AES 128/192/256, ECB, CBC, CTR, KW

* add lc_seeded_rng

* add lc_aead API to provide common interface to AEAD algorithms

* add KyberIES

* change API to Kyber KEM: allow caller to specify size of generated key

* add leancrypto.h for ease of use

* add SymHMAC AEAD algorithm

Changes 0.3.0:
* Introduce lc_rng.h as a common interface to the random number generators

* add KMAC DRNG

* add cSHAKE DRNG

* add SHAKE-128

* add dilithium signature PQC schema - test vectors were generated by leancrypto, but compared with the reference implementation which calculate the same results

* add kyber KEM PQC schema - test vectors were generated by leancrypto, but compared with the reference implementation which calculate the same results

* add cSHAKE AEAD cipher

* KMAC-AEAD cipher: auth key is now set to 256 bits
