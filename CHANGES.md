Changes 0.7.0-prerelease:

* enhancement: add XDRBG256 - the SHAKE256-based DRNG discussed for SP800-90A
  inclusion (almost idential to cSHAKE/KMAC DRNG specified with leancrypto)

* enhancement: add SymKMAC AEAD algorithm - it uses 100 bytes less context than
  SymHMAC (it is less than 1024 bytes now), uses accelerated Keccak for KDF and
  authentication but is otherwise identical to SymHMAC

Changes 0.6.0:

* enhancement: Linux - add memfd_secret(2) support for secure memory allocation

* fix: documentation of lc_kyber_keypair

* enhancement: remove the rng_ctx parameter in all Kyber APIs except the key
  generation - internally lc_seeded_rng is used instead

* enhancement: use -Wmissing-prototypes and fix reported issues

* enhancement: provide standalone CBC, CTR, KW implementation

* enhancement: provide AESNI implementation

* enhancement: provide AES ARM CE implementation

* enhancement: provide AES RISC-V 64 assembler implementation

* enhancement: provide Linux kernel configuration option to enable startup
  health tests

* fix: apply fixes such that all self tests and regression tests pass when compiled for Linux kernel

* fix: properly zeroize memory when using the workspace memory

Changes 0.5.3:

* convert to safe min/max implementations

* enhancement: allow kernel modules to be compiled directly from installed user space headers

* enhancement: make ARMv8 code compile on macOS

- use O3 compiler optimization instead of Os - O3 is significantly faster especially for Kyber C implementation, yet both options work fine

Changes 0.5.2
* enhancement: add ARMv7 Neon assembler support for Keccak

* enhancement: add but disable ARMv8 Neon assembler support for Keccak (it is
  slower than optimized C)

* enhancement: add sign/update/final Dilithium APIs

* enhancement: add RISC-V assembler support for Keccak (yet disabled)

* enhancement: add ARMv8 assembler implementation of Kyber

* enhancement: add counter KDF RNG interface

* enhancement: add ARMv8 assembler and ARMv8 CE Keccak support

Changes 0.5.1:
* enhancement: add Linux kernel configuration options

* enhancement: add lc_rerun_selftests API

* enhancement: add AVX2 support for memcmp_secure

* fix: some comments

Changes 0.5.0:
* enhancement: add ability to compile leancrypto for the Linux kernel including
  all tests

* enhancement: make leancrypto generic such that it can be used in environments
  other than user space

* enhancement: add compile time option small_stack which ensures that
  leancrypto's stack usage is always less than 2048 (also verified by the
  compiler warning if it is bigger)

* enhancement: Add assembler accelerations for SHA3 (AVX2 and AVX512 are
  verified with NIST's ACVP service)

* bug fix: Fix the SHA-3 C implementation on big-endian system (one byte-swap
  missing)

* bug fix: SHAKE128 state had wrong size causing an overflow with the
  memset_secure in lc_hash_zero

* fix: remove compile-time warnings on 32 bit systems

* enhancement: SHAKE AVX2 4x implementation used by Kyber AVX2 implementation

* enhancement: Kyber AVX2 support

* enhancement: Dilithium AVX2 support

* leancrypto tested on macOS with an M2 system

* bug fix: Dilithium C on Big Endian had implicit type casts leading to
  endianess issues

* enhancement: add RPM SPEC file - successful build on OpenSUSE build service
  on x86_64, i586, aarch64, armv7l, armv6l, ppc64, ppc64le, riscv64

* rename memset_secure to lc_memset_secure preventing any possible name space clash

* enhancement: add self tests to all algorithms

* bug fix: ChaCha20 on BigEndian systems

Changes 0.4.0:
* simplify Kyber code

* add RNG context to HKDF

* add RNG context to KMAC

* add AES 128/192/256, ECB, CBC, CTR, KW

* add lc_seeded_rng

* add lc_aead API to provide common interface to AEAD algorithms

* add KyberIES

* change API to Kyber KEM: allow caller to specify size of generated key

* add leancrypto.h for ease of use

* add SymHMAC AEAD algorithm

* add cSHAKE 128

* add KMAC 128

Changes 0.3.0:
* Introduce lc_rng.h as a common interface to the random number generators

* add KMAC DRNG

* add cSHAKE DRNG

* add SHAKE-128

* add dilithium signature PQC schema - test vectors were generated by leancrypto, but compared with the reference implementation which calculate the same results

* add kyber KEM PQC schema - test vectors were generated by leancrypto, but compared with the reference implementation which calculate the same results

* add cSHAKE AEAD cipher

* KMAC-AEAD cipher: auth key is now set to 256 bits
