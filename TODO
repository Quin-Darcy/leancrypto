- linker version script - how do do that with meson?

- Linux kernel Makefile: make clean does not prune files generated by sources
  wrapped in ifdefs in Makefile

- how to detect ARMv6 (in contrast to ARMv7) such that ARMv7 Neon code is only
  compiled for target host ARMv7 - at the moment compiling on ARMv6 fails
  because the Neon code is compiled (which should not be compiled)

- Add Ascon-AEAD / Ascon-Keccak-AEAD to skcipher API

- add more Rust wrappers

- Linux kernel: add support for parallel Kyber/Dilithium support (at the moment this would require generating a separate .o file for the Kyber-768/512 and Dilithium-65/44 compile runs which then is linked into leancrypto.o to get leancrypto.ko - this compilation of a "sub-o-file" (like the static library supported by Meson) is not available).
