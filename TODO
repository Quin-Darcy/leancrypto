- linker version script - how do do that with meson?

- Linux kernel Makefile: make clean does not prune files generated by sources
  wrapped in ifdefs in Makefile

- make ASM symbols hidden (see libleancrypto.so.0.p/libleancrypto.so.0.symbols)

- how to detect ARMv6 (in contrast to ARMv7) such that ARMv7 Neon code is only
  compiled for target host ARMv7 - at the moment compiling on ARMv6 fails
  because the Neon code is compiled (which should not be compiled)

- should compiler options of -ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero and
  -fzero-call-used-regs=used-gpr be set? If yes, what is the performance impact?
  What about older compilers?
