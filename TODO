- linker version script - how do I do that with meson?

- Linux kernel Makefile: make clean does not prune files generated by sources
  wrapped in ifdefs in Makefile

- how to detect ARMv6 (in contrast to ARMv7) such that ARMv7 Neon code is only
  compiled for target host ARMv7 - at the moment compiling on ARMv6 fails
  because the Neon code is compiled (which should not be compiled)

- add more Rust wrappers

- provide version numbers in one place (currently found in meson.build, leancrypto.spec and Kbuild.version)

- AES C implementation: remove side-channels in implementation
